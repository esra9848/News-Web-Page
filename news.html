                  Italy's anti-trust authority says the Alphabet company abused its market position
                  by blocking an app called Enel X for users of electric vehicles on Android and app store.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    </b>
                 Italy's anti-trust authority has fined Google more than $120 million (100 million euros)
                   for shutting out a rival's smartphone app offering recharging of electric vehicles.
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   Google's Android operating system and Google Play app store dominate the Italian market,
                   and the authority said the firm abused its market position by blocking an Enel X app for users of electric vehicles.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   "We respectfully disagree with the authority’s decision and we will review our options," a Google spokesman said in a statement.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   He added that some apps are not supported on the Android Auto platform "based on driver-distraction tests and regulatory and industry standards".
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The fine of more than $120 million is for a violation of article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which regulates monopolies and issues involving restriction of competition.

                <p>JuicePass offers services relating to recharging electric vehicles, such as finding the nearest charging station and reserving a space there.</p><p>"By refusing Enel X Italia interoperability with Android Auto, Google has unfairly limited the possibilities for end-users to avail themselves of the Enel X Italia app when driving and recharging an electric vehicle," the authority stated.</p><p>"Google has consequently favoured its own Google Maps app," added the authority.</p><p>"The exclusion of the Enel X Italia app from Android Auto has been going on for more than two years, and if it were to continue, could permanently jeopardise Enel X Italia's chances of building a solid user base at a time of significant growth in sales of electric vehicles."</p>

            <p>Joe Biden has been president for more than 100 days. The drumbeat of policy-making has moved on to pandemic relief and infrastructure spending.</p>
            <p>
                And yet in Mar-a-Lago, Trump is still complaining about his election loss. In Washington, Republicans just booted Liz Cheney, who said Biden was legitimately elected, from her congressional leadership post.

            </p>
            <p>
                And in Phoenix, Arizona, they're still counting - or technically, auditing - ballots.
            </p>
            <h4>
                What is the audit?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The audit is a review of more than two million ballots cast in Maricopa County - which includes Phoenix - ordered by the Republican majority that controls Arizona's state Senate.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
                Joe Biden carried Maricopa County by more than 45,000 votes on the way to winning Arizona by 10,457 votes. He was the first Democrat to take the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.
            </p>
            pRepublican audit backers theorise that if they can find substantive evidence of fraud then it means Trump really won Arizona. If Trump really won Arizona, maybe he really won other states he narrowly lost. And if he really won enough other states, then he really won the election.
            <p>All this requires extreme logical contortions, but it's what they're rolling with.</p>
            <p>It's also worth noting that the Republican-controlled Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, which ran the county's election process and reviewed its results, stands behind their original tally and has had no interest in participating in the process.</p>

                              President Joe Biden has hailed a "great day for America" as US officials said vaccinated people can go mask-less in most indoor and outdoor settings.

                              The president removed his mask in the Oval Office with Republican lawmakers as the guidance was being announced.

                              The advice still calls for wearing masks in crowded indoor settings like buses, planes and hospitals.

                              The Biden administration has faced pressure to ease restrictions on fully vaccinated people.

                              In another major step for the US in returning to pre-pandemic life, the president of the 1.7m-member American Federation of Teachers labour union called for schools to reopen fully in the autumn.
                              The US coronavirus caseload has fallen to its lowest point since last September, with deaths at their fewest since last April.

                              According to the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical distancing can also cease for the fully vaccinated.

                              Mr Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and staff went without facial coverings during a White House Rose Garden event to trumpet the new guidelines.

                              "We're not going to go out and arrest people," added Mr Biden, urging non-vaccinated Americans to wear masks.

                              His Twitter account posted: "The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. The choice is yours." The US president has no power to order Americans to get vaccinated or wear masks.

                              <strong>The Turkish Grand Prix has been cancelled just six weeks after it was put on the Formula 1 calendar and replaced by a second race in Austria.</strong> <br>
                              Turkey was added to the F1 schedule on 11-13 June to replace the Canadian Grand Prix, which was cancelled because of travel restrictions in Canada.

                              But Turkey has now become unworkable after being put on the UK's travel red list of high-risk countries.

                              F1 will instead run a race at the Red Bull Ring on 25-27 June.

                              That date was originally scheduled for the French Grand Prix, which has now been moved a week earlier to 18-20 June.

                              The move means there will now be races on three consecutive weekends - the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard, followed by the Styrian Grand Prix and then the Austrian Grand Prix, both at the same track.
                              F1 president Stefano Domenicali said: "We were all looking forward to racing in Turkey but the travel restrictions in place have meant we are not able to be there in June.

                              "F1 has shown again that it is able to react quickly to developments and find solutions and we are delighted that we will have a double header in Austria, meaning our season remains at 23 races."

                              F1 has a series of protocols aimed at minimising the risk of spreading Covid-19 and says it has conducted 17,000 tests this year with only 15 positive cases, a rate of 0.1%. It says it will "continue to operate in a way that protects the safety of our personnel and the communities we visit".

                              A number of F1 insiders had hoped that the sport's owners, Liberty Media, would not replace Turkey with another event.

                              Teams are already finding the combination of a record 23-race planned schedule and the restrictions on movement imposed on personnel when they return to the UK exhausting.

                              Some senior figures believe that there is no need to keep the number of races so high, when the sport has never had a season this long before.

                              But F1 feels that it makes sense to maintain the number of races that had been planned in the first half of the year because they have concerns about the viability of a number of late-season races.

                              For different reasons, there are uncertainties over the Singapore, Japanese, US, Mexican, Brazilian and Australian Grands Prix.

                              Those races currently comprise the sport's entire schedule for October and November.

                              There are financial implications involving both sponsors and broadcasters that would hit F1's finances - and the prize money paid to teams next year - if the number of races falls too far.

                              Brazil and Mexico are a concern because the scale of the pandemic in those countries means F1 may feel it cannot justify going there.

                              Doubts over Singapore, Japan, the US and Australia are more to do with travel restrictions imposed on foreign visitors by those countries.

                             <strong>Israel has intensified its assault on Gaza, as Palestinian militants continue to fire rockets into Israel on the fifth day of hostilities.</strong><br>
                             Israel's military said air and ground forces were involved in attacks on Friday but had not entered Gaza.

                            Video from Gaza City showed the night sky lit up by explosions from Israeli artillery, gunboats and air strikes.

                            Some 119 people have been killed in Gaza and eight have died in Israel since fighting began on Monday.
                            Meanwhile, Jewish and Israeli-Arab mobs have been fighting within Israel, prompting its president to warn of civil war.

                            Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a "massive reinforcement" of security forces to suppress the internal unrest that has seen more than 400 people arrested.

                            Police say Israeli Arabs have been responsible for most of the trouble and reject the accusation that they are standing by while gangs of Jewish youths target Arab homes.
                            This week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It came after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.
                            In Gaza, Palestinians fearing an incursion by Israeli troops have been fleeing areas close to the border with Israel. Residents who had left Shejaiya in Gaza City said shells had been falling on homes.

                            "We felt like we were in a horror movie," said local resident Salwa Al-Attar, who escaped the bombardment with her family. "The planes were above us, and the tanks and navy were bombing - and we could not move. The children, women and men were screaming."

                              <strong>The Duke of Sussex has said he wants to "break the cycle" of the "pain and suffering" of his upbringing with his own children.</strong> <br>
                              Turkey was added to the F1 schedule on 11-13 June to replace the Canadian Grand Prix, which was cancelled because of travel restrictions in Canada.

                              Prince Harry, who is expecting a daughter with wife Meghan and is already father to their son Archie, said he did not want to pass on pain from his own experience.

                            But he said he did not think "we should be pointing the finger" at anybody.

                            Buckingham Palace and Clarence House declined to comment on his remarks.

                            During an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast, Prince Harry compared his life to a mixture of the film The Truman Show, in which the main character unwittingly lives his life on a TV show, and being in a zoo.

                            He said in being born into the Royal Family "you inherit every element of it without choice", including that the UK media "feel an ownership over you".
                            Prince Harry told American actor and podcast co-host Dax Shepard: "I don't think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting, if I've experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I'm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don't pass it on, basically.

                            "It's a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on," he said, adding that parents should be trying to stop that happening.

                            He said: "I started to piece it together and go 'okay, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his life, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he's treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids?'"
                            The 36-year-old duke said he was in his early twenties when he thought: "I don't want this job, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be doing this. Look what it did to my mum, how am I ever going to settle down and have a wife and family when I know that it's going to happen again?

                            "I've seen behind the curtain, I've seen the business model. I know how this operation runs and how it works, I don't want to be part of this."

                            In the wide-ranging 90-minute interview, the prince said his family's move to the US had not been part of the plan but he had to put his family and their mental health first.

                            On his and Meghan's life in Los Angeles, California, he said: "Living here now I can actually lift my head and I feel different, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that."

                            BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said, for the palaces, Prince Harry's comments come "firmly on the private side of the curtain".
                            "That's not to say that they don't talk about it behind the curtain. It's been put to me by various people in different quarters that this is largely as a result of Meghan, that Harry is - or was - happier in his role before Meghan," he said.

                            "But Harry himself says in this podcast... that Meghan was part of the process of him understanding that there was a different way, and a different place for him to be. So he's pretty open about that."

                            During the episode, Prince Harry says he decided to go to therapy after a conversation with Meghan. "Suddenly it was like the bubble was burst," he said.

                            "I plucked my head out of the sand, gave it a good shake off and I was like, 'Okay, you're in this position of privilege, stop complaining or stop thinking as though you want something different. Make this different, because you can't get out.'"
