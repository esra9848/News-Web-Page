                            <p>The Portuguese government is yet to decide whether or not to lift travel restrictions on supporters hoping to attend the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea in Porto, a spokesperson has said.</p><p>"No decision has been taken," said government spokeswoman Mariana Vieira da Silva after a cabinet meeting on Thursday.</p><p>The match had been moved from Istanbul in order to allow English fans to attend as Portugal is on the British government's green travel list.</p><p>But Portugal is still only allowing essential travel into the country from the UK.</p><p>"On flights from the United Kingdom ... there is work ongoing, as soon as a decision is taken, it will be communicated," Vieira da Silva added.</p><p>Flights with the UK were suspended in January in Portugal due to new coronavirus variants. The suspension was lifted on April 16, but only for essential travel.</p>
                            <p><strong>Location change</strong></p><p>Vieira da Silva added that if fans are able to travel, they will have to stay in the country for less than 24 hours, return a negative coronavirus test result before flying, and "not have contact" with Portuguese residents.</p><p>Portugal has been gradually easing coronavirus restrictions and is one of 12 countries the British government has said people can travel to without having to quarantine on return from May 17.</p><p>UEFA announced earlier on Thursday that the Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea had been moved from Istanbul to Porto.</p><p>The match on May 29 has been switched to the Estadio do Dragao to allow English spectators to attend as travel between the UK and Turkey is suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

                                   <p>"Stop Tokyo Olympics" campaign organiser Kenji Utsunomiya
                                    said the global festival of sport - already postponed from 2020
                                    due to the coronavirus pandemic - should take place only when
                                    Japan can welcome visitors and athletes wholeheartedly.</p><p>"We are not in that situation and therefore the Games should
                                    be cancelled," he told a news conference. "Precious medical
                                    resources would need to be diverted to the Olympics if it's
                                    held."</p><p>The petition was submitted to the Olympic and Paralympic
                                    committee chiefs as well as Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike.</p>
                                    <p>It came as Japan added three more areas to a state of
                                        emergency now covering Tokyo, Osaka and four other prefectures
                                        amid surging case numbers, less than three months out from the
                                        scheduled July 23 start of the Games.</p><p>Asked about the anti-Games campaign, Tokyo Governor Koike
                                        said she would continue to work towards a "safe and secure"
                                        Olympics.</p><p>"Though there is a global pandemic, it is important to hold
                                        safe and secure Tokyo 2020 Games," she told a regular press
                                        conference.</p><p>The new areas under the state of emergency include Hokkaido
                                        prefecture where the Olympic marathon will take place, after the
                                        prefecture reported a record high of 712 new coronavirus cases
                                        on Thursday.</p><p>Opposition to the Games has also come from doctors, while
                                        some high-profile Japanese athletes have expressed concern,

              Fifa President Gianni Infantino says he looks forward to the first edition of the already
              agreed new 24-team men's Club World Cup 
             but a women's version is in the pipeline too.
             </b> <br>
             Fifa President Gianni Infantino has said a new Women's Club World Cup is being planned as part of a plan to "revolutionise" the female game.

            In an interview with French sports newspaper L'Equipe, Infantino said he was looking forward to the first edition of the already agreed new 24-team men's Club World Cup but said a women's version was in the pipeline too.

            "My dream is also to see the birth of the very first Women's Club World Cup. It’s coming very soon. And it will really revolutionise women's football," he said.
            Such a tournament would allow for the top European teams from UEFA's Women's Champions League to face off with clubs from the United States' National Women's Soccer League as well as sides from countries where the women's game is still developing.

            The US women's national team are the current world champions and the dominant force in the game. However, top European men's clubs have invested heavily in their women's sides in recent years.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8 mt-3">
                Infantino has previously floated the idea of the Women's World Cup, for national sides, being played every two years rather than the current four year cycle.
  
                The Club World Cup is being expanded from a relatively low-key tournament involving seven teams, including just one from Europe, to a 24-team event including eight sides from Europe which Fifa hopes will be a major revenue generator, similar to the World Cup itself.  4
                The first version of the new tournament was due to be held in China in June and July this year but was postponed after the Covid-19 pandemic forced the 2020 European Championship to be delayed by 12 months.
  
                FIFA's current position is that the Club World Cup is an event to be held every four years, but previously there has been talk of it being an annual one.
  
                "What I'm sure is that this new competition will eventually become the best club event in the world, and help develop football on all continents. It will offer a real possibility for clubs from all regions to reach the highest level while giving the big clubs, especially European ones, a unique playing field in which to compete," he said.

                              President Joe Biden has hailed a "great day for America" as US officials said vaccinated people can go mask-less in most indoor and outdoor settings.

                              The president removed his mask in the Oval Office with Republican lawmakers as the guidance was being announced.

                              The advice still calls for wearing masks in crowded indoor settings like buses, planes and hospitals.

                              The Biden administration has faced pressure to ease restrictions on fully vaccinated people.

                              In another major step for the US in returning to pre-pandemic life, the president of the 1.7m-member American Federation of Teachers labour union called for schools to reopen fully in the autumn.
                              The US coronavirus caseload has fallen to its lowest point since last September, with deaths at their fewest since last April.

                              According to the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical distancing can also cease for the fully vaccinated.

                              Mr Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and staff went without facial coverings during a White House Rose Garden event to trumpet the new guidelines.

                              "We're not going to go out and arrest people," added Mr Biden, urging non-vaccinated Americans to wear masks.

                              His Twitter account posted: "The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do. The choice is yours." The US president has no power to order Americans to get vaccinated or wear masks.

                              <strong>The Turkish Grand Prix has been cancelled just six weeks after it was put on the Formula 1 calendar and replaced by a second race in Austria.</strong> <br>
                              Turkey was added to the F1 schedule on 11-13 June to replace the Canadian Grand Prix, which was cancelled because of travel restrictions in Canada.

                              But Turkey has now become unworkable after being put on the UK's travel red list of high-risk countries.

                              F1 will instead run a race at the Red Bull Ring on 25-27 June.

                              That date was originally scheduled for the French Grand Prix, which has now been moved a week earlier to 18-20 June.

                              The move means there will now be races on three consecutive weekends - the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard, followed by the Styrian Grand Prix and then the Austrian Grand Prix, both at the same track.
                              F1 president Stefano Domenicali said: "We were all looking forward to racing in Turkey but the travel restrictions in place have meant we are not able to be there in June.

                              "F1 has shown again that it is able to react quickly to developments and find solutions and we are delighted that we will have a double header in Austria, meaning our season remains at 23 races."

                              F1 has a series of protocols aimed at minimising the risk of spreading Covid-19 and says it has conducted 17,000 tests this year with only 15 positive cases, a rate of 0.1%. It says it will "continue to operate in a way that protects the safety of our personnel and the communities we visit".

                              A number of F1 insiders had hoped that the sport's owners, Liberty Media, would not replace Turkey with another event.

                              Teams are already finding the combination of a record 23-race planned schedule and the restrictions on movement imposed on personnel when they return to the UK exhausting.

                              Some senior figures believe that there is no need to keep the number of races so high, when the sport has never had a season this long before.

                              But F1 feels that it makes sense to maintain the number of races that had been planned in the first half of the year because they have concerns about the viability of a number of late-season races.

                              For different reasons, there are uncertainties over the Singapore, Japanese, US, Mexican, Brazilian and Australian Grands Prix.

                              Those races currently comprise the sport's entire schedule for October and November.

                              There are financial implications involving both sponsors and broadcasters that would hit F1's finances - and the prize money paid to teams next year - if the number of races falls too far.

                              Brazil and Mexico are a concern because the scale of the pandemic in those countries means F1 may feel it cannot justify going there.

                              Doubts over Singapore, Japan, the US and Australia are more to do with travel restrictions imposed on foreign visitors by those countries.

                             <strong>Israel has intensified its assault on Gaza, as Palestinian militants continue to fire rockets into Israel on the fifth day of hostilities.</strong><br>
                             Israel's military said air and ground forces were involved in attacks on Friday but had not entered Gaza.

                            Video from Gaza City showed the night sky lit up by explosions from Israeli artillery, gunboats and air strikes.

                            Some 119 people have been killed in Gaza and eight have died in Israel since fighting began on Monday.
                            Meanwhile, Jewish and Israeli-Arab mobs have been fighting within Israel, prompting its president to warn of civil war.

                            Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a "massive reinforcement" of security forces to suppress the internal unrest that has seen more than 400 people arrested.

                            Police say Israeli Arabs have been responsible for most of the trouble and reject the accusation that they are standing by while gangs of Jewish youths target Arab homes.
                            This week's violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It came after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes.
                            In Gaza, Palestinians fearing an incursion by Israeli troops have been fleeing areas close to the border with Israel. Residents who had left Shejaiya in Gaza City said shells had been falling on homes.

                            "We felt like we were in a horror movie," said local resident Salwa Al-Attar, who escaped the bombardment with her family. "The planes were above us, and the tanks and navy were bombing - and we could not move. The children, women and men were screaming."
